        TensorBoard provides the visualization and tooling needed for
        machine learning experimentation:
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">
          <li>Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy</li>
          <li>Visualizing the model graph (ops and layers)</li>
          <li>Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they
              change over time</li>
          <li>Projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space</li>
          <li>Displaying images, text, and audio data</li>
          <li>Profiling TensorFlow programs</li>
          <li>And much more</li>
